## How Jungian ideas were used

The app builds Jungian thinking directly into the prompts. Instead of letting the AI guess what to do, the prompt tells it to act like a Jungian analyst and talk about archetypes, the shadow, anima or animus, the collective unconscious, and individuation. It also tells the model to focus on symbolic meaning and not predictions or superstition. That makes the response sound more like reflection and less like a dream dictionary.

For the image, the dream text is turned into a symbolic scene with words like surreal, painterly, and psychological symbolism. This pushes the image model to represent feelings and relationships between objects instead of copying the literal event. So a wolf chasing someone becomes a dark symbolic pursuit connected to inner conflict rather than just a normal animal attack.

## User guide

Open the site and type a dream into the text box. Click interpret dream. The page shows a short loading state while the server sends the dream to the AI. After a moment a new page appears.

You will see three parts. First is the original dream you wrote. Second is a Jungian interpretation explaining possible symbolic meaning. Third is an image representing the emotional idea of the dream. You can click new dream to try another one. The site does not save anything permanently.

## Reflection and improvements

The biggest lesson was how important prompt wording is. Small wording changes made the AI switch from generic explanations to thoughtful psychological ones. The images also showed meaning faster than text, which fits Jung’s idea that dreams communicate visually.

Possible improvements include keeping a dream journal history, letting users pick short or long interpretations, and tracking repeating symbols across multiple dreams to create a more personal analysis over time.
